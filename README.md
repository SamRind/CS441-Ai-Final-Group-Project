CS441/541 Artificial Intelligence: A Maze Solver

Developers: Charlene Namuyige, Leah Moser, Natasha Needham, Salem Alathari, Sam Rind 

# Brief Description: 
A maze is a network of paths designed as a puzzle where an agent would need to find the specific path that leads to the exit. This maze solver is intended to find a route from start to finish in this maze. 
There exists a number of algorithms that can generate and solve a maze solver in artificial intelligence. 

# Genetic Algorithm 
A genetic algorithm is a search heuristic that is inspired by Charles Darwin's theory of natural evolution. This algorithm reflects the process of natural selection where the fittest individuals are selected for reproduction in order to produce offspring of the next generation. 
*Initial Population:
